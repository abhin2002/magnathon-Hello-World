# Empty Bin - MAGNATHON
 We aim to predict the amount of food and predict their qualities in domains like 
community kitchen, restaurant, school/collage mess and all of the food industry by utilizing 
supervised machine learning.

If we could accurately predict the amount of raw materials and thereby the amount of food through
everyday analysis we can minimise the quantity of food waste drastically and thereby 
provide for the needy.
