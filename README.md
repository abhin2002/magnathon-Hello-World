# Empty Bin - MAGNATHON
 We aim to predict the amount of food and predict their qualities in domains like 
community kitchen, restaurant, school/collage mess and all of the food industry by utilizing 
supervised machine learning.If we could accurately predict the amount of raw materials and thereby the amount of food through
everyday analysis we can minimise the quantity of food waste drastically and thereby 
provide for the needy.
Supervised Machine Learning has lately proved to be one of the most prominent and
efficiently improving methods comprising of several solid techniques and algorithms for
the classification, manipulation, and reorganization of databases using the concepts
recursive learning.

## Link to Project
[Empty Bin-Food Quantity Prediction](https://github.com/abhin2002/Food_Quantity_Prediction)

## How it Works ?
**Quantity of food produced:**<br />
we intent to build a supervised machine learning model, trained using a general
Dataset regarding the demand for food and can predict the quantity of food
required for a given set of variables<br />
The trained model can later be fine tuned using the data of a specific location so
that the produce more locally accurate results<br />
The algorithm used for learning is based on naive bayes and logistic regression
classifiers
